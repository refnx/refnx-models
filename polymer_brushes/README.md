# FreeformVFP

Creates a flexible ('freeform') profile which is constrained by the interfacial volume of material
(itself a fittable parameter). The profile itself can be constrained to be monotonic. This model
was designed to replicate the structure of a polymer brush, but would be well suited to any diffuse
interface where the interfacial volume can be approximated.

# numerical self-consistent field theory

Adapts the public domain nSCFT code written for Refl1D by Paul Kienzle and Richard Sheridan.
The work of Sheridan et al. should be cited if this code is used: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.7b00639
